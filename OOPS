Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit 
and restricting direct access to the internal state. In Java, this is achieved using private variables and 
public getter and setter methods. This ensures data security and prevents unintended modification. 
In Selenium automation, encapsulation is commonly used in the Page Object Model, 
where web elements are kept private inside a page class and accessed through public methods. 
This makes the framework more maintainable, readable, and protects the internal page structure 
from being accessed or modified directly by test scripts.

Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods of another class, 
enabling code reusability and hierarchical relationships. 
In Java, this is implemented using the extends keyword. 
Selenium heavily relies on inheritance in its architecture; for example, ChromeDriver inherits 
functionality from RemoteWebDriver, which in turn implements the WebDriver interface. 
This means browser-specific drivers do not need to re-implement common browser operations. 
In automation frameworks, inheritance is also used when a base test class contains common setup and teardown 
logic that is reused by multiple test classes.

Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows the same method or object reference to behave differently based on the actual object it refers to. 
In Selenium, this is widely used through the WebDriver interface. 
For example, the same WebDriver reference can point to ChromeDriver, 
FirefoxDriver, or EdgeDriver, and the same test code will work across all browsers. 
This makes Selenium highly flexible and supports cross-browser testing without changing the test scripts. 
Polymorphism improves scalability and reduces duplication of code in automation frameworks.

Abstraction

Abstraction means hiding implementation details and exposing only what is 
necessary to the user. In Java, abstraction is achieved using interfaces and abstract classes. 
Selenium uses abstraction by providing the WebDriver interface, which defines what browser operations can be performed, 
such as clicking, navigating, and finding elements, without exposing how those operations are implemented internally. 
The actual logic is handled by concrete classes like ChromeDriver or FirefoxDriver. 
This allows testers to write browser-independent test scripts while Selenium manages the complexity behind the scenes.
